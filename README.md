# jom-windows-arm64

[Jom](https://wiki.qt.io/Jom) is a clone of nmake to support the execution of multiple independent commands in parallel. It basically adds the -j command line switch similar to GNU make. 

This repository builds jom for Windows on ARM64 (WoA), which is useful for developing Qt 5 projects on WoA systems. 

The downloads are available at the [release](https://github.com/minnyres/jom-windows-arm64/releases) page.
